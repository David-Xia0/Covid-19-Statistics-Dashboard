Executive summary

Compsci 335 as introudced a lot of fundamental web development techniques that heavily influenced the website design.
One important aspect was learning to to obtain data from a service endpoint, using fetch and XHR. This website uses fetch to obtain all the Covid-19 statistical data from the endpoint: "https://api.thevirustracker.com/free-api?countryTimeline=NZ". Furthremore, as the endpoint dynamically updates its data so does the website. This helps provide the most relevant data to the user.
The introduction and utilisation of Javascript has also been important in coverting the endpoint data into meaningful information to display on the website. 

The statistics are displayed as both numbers and graphs. The graphs are generated as SVG elements.
SVG elements can be dynamically produced. This was very helpful when dealing with the dynmaic data provided by the endpoints. 
There are in total three SVG graphs that help display the trends and effects of Covid-19 over time.
They each seperately show new daily cases, total cumulative deaths and total cumulative cases.
Using the javascript and css taught in class, the website is also able to selectively display the graphs. This is so the page is not crowded with data and the user and view each graph individually.
lastly, on the right handside, there is a simple list of the most relevant stats and information.

The look and feel of the website has also been influcenced by the ccs styling taught in the course. 
The websites elements have been designed to present the information simplistically to the user and resizes according to screen size.
This has also allowed the website to be suitably viewed on small screens or mobile devices.
